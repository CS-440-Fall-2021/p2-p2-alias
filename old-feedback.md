- The whole process did not feel as enjoyable as I would have expected it to be. Having said that, I understand that this semester has been different for all of us, and perhaps if we were in a normal semester, we as a group, could have done better.
- Since its my last feedback, I would again appreciate the general quality of assignments and projects in the course. I always felt the assignments to be extremely well crafted and learning intensive. Thank you for your efforts in creating extremely well crafted assignments and well defined rubrics.
- I feel things got a bit too overwhelming since the project was due this late into the semester. The project did look interesting and I believe under different circumstances I would have enjoyed working on it.
- I was unable to complete this project, or feel satisfied with my submission, which is quite sad because I was very excited to do the project. I think the late release date, that clashed with finals week and my own health severely deteriorating was to blame.
- This project took considerably more time then any other assignment/project I had this semester. I think a part of the problem was that it was due during exam week. My team and I ended up spending an entire night working on adding the functionality to import any mesh into the scene. I enjoyed the project, but It was definitely the most stressful/time consuming project of the semester. especially considering the time frame.
- The project was very interesting, but got a bit difficult to execute as it was done during the exam weeks. In a normal semester the quality of the work for this project would have been much better.
